** Cropping

Need to test cropping more.

Need a good interface for specifying cropping.

** Faster Linking

If the cached copy is available we should link directly from IMG etc
to it rather than indirecting via the CGI.

** Icons

Icons should be separate URLs, not built-in, so they can be more
conveniently changed.

** Cache Filenames

Should be generated from the command, not via a separate process.

Local variables:
mode:outline
