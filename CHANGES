(See 'changelog' or 'bzr log' output for detailed changes, or
'changelog.arch' for older ones.)

* Changes in Lyle 0.10

Filenames are now compared with respect to the numeric value of
embedded integers.  This means that (for instance) where formerly
10.jpeg would sort before 2.jpeg, now it will sort afterwards.

* Changes in Lyle 0.9

Lyle no longer discards color profiles embedded in JPEGs.  This
prevented profile-aware browsers such as Safari from correctly display
on non-sRGB displays.  Non-profile-aware browsers are still stuffed on
non-sRGB displays (or with non-sRGB images, but you didn't want to put
those on the web anyway).

Lyle has been updated to work with the Perlmagick from Debian etch.

* Changes in Lyle 0.8

New @autodirs lets you automatically include directories without
havign to update configuration file.

* Changes in Lyle 0.7

Renamed to "Lyle" as there is already a program called "Gallery" with
similar functionality.  The executable scripts are therefore renamed:
  gallery -> lyle.cgi
  galleryize -> lyle-refresh

Obviously you don't have to install it under the new name if that's
inconvenient.

Renamed some variables for greater consistency:
  $gallery -> $lyleurl
  $fsroot -> $rootdir
  $webroot -> $rooturl

* Changes in gallery 0.6

Each image in a thumbnail list gets an anchor, and links to a page
with that anchor appended.  See css.txt for hints as to how to use
this most effectively.

New $jpegquality controls JPEG quality.

New %comments array contains HTML comments for each picture.

New "f/..." link gives you jhead output.

* Changes in gallery 0.5

Scaling is now done in terms of separate width/height bounds.

Improved error handling.

** New 'galleryize' program

This program can be used to generate skeleton info.pl files.  See the
README for more information.

* Changes in gallery 0.4

** New Features

New templating system.  See the README for more details about this.

PNG files are now supported.

** Bugs Fixed

Hyphens are now allowed in filenames.

The cache is regenerated if info.pl changes as well as if the
directory changes.

* Changes in gallery 0.3

The configuration file is sanity checked at startup.

All image operations are done via the Image::Magick Perl interface,
rather than invoking the command-line programs.

Various CLASS attributes added to allow for more interesting CSSish
stuff.  See css.txt.

Thumbnails can be controlled by pixel height as well as scale.

Slightly improved error handling.

Regenerate cached info if directory changes.

* Changes in gallery 0.2

The icons are separate files, not built into the script.

Thumbnails are generated as the thumbnail page is constructed, and the
IMG URLs point into the cache, rather than requiring another
invocation of the script.  No locking is performed when generating
thumbnails.

The 'jpegtran' program is now required.

Various documentation bugs fixed.
